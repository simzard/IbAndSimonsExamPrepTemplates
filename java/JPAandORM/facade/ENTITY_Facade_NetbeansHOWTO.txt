Facade how to:
1. Netbeans: create new class in package 'facades' call it 'PersonFacade' for example (exchange Person with the Entity object name you need)
2. Netbeans: delete all lines in the file
3. open ENTITY_Facade in a text editor and copy all content (ctrl + a)
4. Netbeans: paste (ctrl + v) the content into PersonFacade.java
5. Netbeans: press ctrl + h (replace) and replace all 'ENTITY_' with 'Person' and AGAIN replace all 'entity_' with 'person'
6. Netbeans: go to line 86 to 89 and REMEMBER to ADJUST the ATTRIBUTES that should be copied according to YOUR entity class


		---------------- OR -------------------

			Use the script (located in this this folder named generate.sh ) :

		1. In linux bash: write(without quotes): 'chmod +x generate.sh' to make the script executable if it is not 
		2. Then write in bash: './generate.sh Person' <---- this will create the file scriptResults/PersonFacade.java
		3. Netbeans: Copy this file into the package facades.


You should now have a working simple CRUD Facade which can access your database through persistence.xml

Usage of Facade:

Facade f = new Facade(Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("INSERT_YOUR_PERSISTENCE_UNIT_NAME_HERE"));
f.get....(); 
....
